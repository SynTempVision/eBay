##### Location Code:
- A structured identifier that defines where the item is physically stored.

🔹 **Step 1: Assign Location During Storage**

- Every item must have an assigned Location Code.
- Location Code may be determined either:
    - Before the item leaves the Processing Area, or
    - Immediately after physical placement.
- Location Code must be recorded as soon as the item is stored.
- No item may remain stored without a documented Location Code.

---

🔹 **Step 2: Location Code Structure**
- Location codes must follow this format:
    - C#-Letter#
      - C# = Container number
      - Letter = Shelf
      - # = Row
```
Example:
C1-A2
C2-B3
C3-D1
```

- Alternate Format (Room-Based Storage):
     - RoomName-AreaIdentifier
```
Examples:
EBAYROOM-N1
EBAYROOM-CENTER
EBAYROOM-SOUTH
```
---

🔹 **Step 3: Moving Items**

If an item is relocated:

- Update its Location Code immediately in eBay.
- Do not rely on memory.
- Do not leave items in temporary undocumented locations.

---

🔹 **Step 4: Retrieval**

When an item sells:

- Retrieve item using Location Code.
- Verify SKU matches order.
- Confirm item matches listing before shipment.
    - use identifying marks pictures if needed

---

##### Rules & Constraints

- Every active listing must have:
    - A 4-digit SKU
    - An assigned Location Code
- No vague location descriptions (example: “back shelf” not allowed).
- No stacking that blocks access.
- No moving items without updating location.
